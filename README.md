# Snake

A mobile optimised take on Snake

This is a small game of Snake, but with a twist. It's optimised for usage on mobile devices, detecting the device orientation and using that to control the movement of the Snake.

Rather than being limited to just four directions of travel, this version of the popular game has a full 360 degree rotation.

Keyboard controls are also supported (Left/Right A/D), but openning this on either a tablet or a phone is far more fun!
